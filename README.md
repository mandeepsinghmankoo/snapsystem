## Smart Navigation Automated Parking System

Snaps (Smart Navigation Automated Parking System) is a revolutionary artificial intelligence model designed to streamline the parking experience through advanced technology and automation. Snaps utilizes cutting-edge AI algorithms to detect license plates from vehicles, manage entries and exits, and calculate parking fares based on the duration of parking.


## Key Features:
* License Plate Detection: Snaps employs sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms to accurately detect and recognize license plates from vehicles entering and exiting the parking facility.

* Automated Entry and Exit: With Snaps, the entire entry and exit process is automated. Users simply drive in and out of the parking facility without the need for manual ticketing or access control.

* Dynamic Fare Calculation: Snaps calculates parking fares dynamically based on the duration of parking. Users are charged accurately for the time their vehicle spends parked in the facility.

* Real-Time Monitoring: Snaps provides real-time monitoring of parking occupancy and availability. Users can check the availability of parking spaces before arriving at the facility, reducing search time and congestion.

* Mobile Integration: Snaps offers seamless integration with mobile applications, allowing users to reserve parking spaces in advance, make payments, and receive notifications about their parking session.

* Enhanced Security: Snaps prioritizes the security of vehicles and users within the parking facility. Advanced surveillance and monitoring systems ensure a safe and secure environment at all times.

New users can register for an account by providing the necessary information, while existing users can log in using their credentials. Once logged in, users can easily find available parking spots through the intuitive dashboard, select a spot, and reserve it for their desired date and time. Upon arrival at the parking facility, users can park their vehicles in their reserved spot, and the Snaps system will automatically detect their license plate and record their entry time. When it's time to leave, users can drive to the exit gate, where the system will calculate the parking fare based on the duration of their stay. Payment can be completed securely through the web app using the available payment methods. For any assistance or feedback, users can reach out to the Snaps support team for prompt assistance.
